# SudokuPuzzle

Work in progress

Solves a Sudoku puzzle

Currently works, at least for all cases I have tried, but the following needs to be done
- Improve comments
- Standardize naming of functions across classes
- Rename all instances of SudokuSolver to SudokuPuzzle to be consistent with other similar projects of mine
- Implement more advanced functions in the analytical search so the brute force search happens less frequently, even with more advanced puzzles
- Improve this README file
